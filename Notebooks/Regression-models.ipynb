In the context of house prices in a city for example, housing units with the same structural characteristics are valued differently in different areas of a city. This would then imply that the same stimulus across a city such as an increase in living area of a housing unit, would affect the housing cost differently in different areas. For example, a more accurate map of the marginal cost of living area in New York City would be as below - where adding a unit square feet of space in downtown Manhattan would increase the housing price by a lot more than that in Staten Island. \n"
